Landing page
This is landing page that uses twitter bootstrap, font_awesome and jquery.
The HTML code is custom and can be edited by anyone.

NOTE: This is challenge for you as a developer to make the page responsive. All the other work has been done for you.
All you need to do, is to add the responsive classes to the existing code. Some responsiveness is added as a guide.

Warm Regards,
